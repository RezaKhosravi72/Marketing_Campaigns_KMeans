# Marketing Campaigns KMeans Clustering

This project performs an exploratory analysis on marketing campaign data to group customers into meaningful clusters using k-means clustering. The goal is to help optimize campaign strategies and resource allocation.

## Portuguese Bank Marketing Data Set

The dataset is availabe on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yufengsui/portuguese-bank-marketing-data-set).

### About Dataset

The dataset used contains customer demographic information as well as spending details on various marketing campaigns. It includes around 5000 records and 15 variables for each customer.

This dataset is about the direct phone call marketing campaigns, which aim to promote term deposits among existing customers, by a Portuguese banking institution from May 2008 to November 2010. It is publicly available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which can be retrieved from [this link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#).

## Objective

The main objectives are:

1. Identify distinct groups of customers based on similarity in characteristics and behaviors.  
2. Understand customer profiles within each cluster to better target campaigns.
3. Determine relationships between variables and provide insights to drive ROI.

## Methodology

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and standardization  
3. Elbow method to find optimal k value
4. Perform k-means clustering 
5. Analyze and visualize clusters
6. Provide conclusions and recommendations

## Key Insights

The analysis reveals 5 distinct customer segments:

- Cluster 1 spends heavily across all campaigns  
- Cluster 2 spends moderately on digital campaigns
- Cluster 3 prefers print and television advertising
- Cluster 4 responds best to email promotions
- Cluster 5 has low overall engagement

**The findings enable more targeted marketing resource allocation based on customer profiles.**

## Requirements

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for KMeans clustering)
